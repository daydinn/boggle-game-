# Progress: Boggle Scoring Method

## Boggle Score Calculation Method

- Implemented a method called `calculateBoggleScore` in the `GameComponent`.
- The method accepts an array of words and calculates the total score based on Boggle rules.
- Rules for scoring:
  - Words with less than 3 letters are ignored.
  - Words with 3 or 4 letters score 1 point.
  - Words with 5 letters score 2 points.
  - Words with 6 letters score 3 points.
  - Words with 7 letters score 5 points.
  - Words with 8 or more letters score 11 points.
- The method uses `reduce()` to accumulate the total score based on the length of each word.
- The method was tested in the `ngOnInit()` lifecycle hook with a sample word list.
- The result is logged to the console and displayed in the game UI.


# Progress: Multiplayer Score Function

## Multiplayer Score Calculation

- Implemented the `calculateMultiplayerScore` function.
- This function accepts an array of players, where each player has a `name` and a list of `words`.
- For each player, their total score is calculated using the existing `calculateBoggleScore` function.
- The function returns an array of objects where each object contains the player's `name` and `score`.
- This design avoids code repetition and ensures the same scoring logic for both single and multiplayer modes.


# Progress: Score Services & Word Entry and Calculation

## 1. Score Functions Moved to Service

The **`calculateBoggleScore`** and **`calculateMultiplayerScore`** functions were refactored and moved from the `GameComponent` into the **`ScoreService`**. This helps with better separation of concerns and allows the score logic to be reused across other components, if needed.

Key Changes:
- Created a new service: **ScoreService**.
- Moved the **`calculateBoggleScore`** method to handle the scoring logic for individual words based on length.
- Moved the **`calculateMultiplayerScore`** method to handle multiple playersâ€™ scores, making it reusable and easier to maintain.

## 2. Manual Word Entry for Score Calculation

A new functionality was introduced to allow users to manually enter words, and the score is calculated based solely on the length of the entered words. This feature ignores whether the words are valid or meaningful, focusing only on the word length for scoring. Additionally, the words entered by the user are displayed below the form in a list. This allows the user to see the words they have entered.

Key Changes:
- Added a form input where users can manually enter words.
- Used **`ngModel`** for two-way data binding in the input field to dynamically capture the user's input.
- Implemented the following key methods:
  - **`submitWord()`**: Handles word submission, checks word validity, and recalculates the total score. Clears the input after submission.
  - **`calculateTotalScore()`**: Uses **`ScoreService`** to update the total score based on the entered words.


  
# Progress: Random Board Generation & Styling and Routing fix
A new method, generateRandomBoard, was introduced in the GameComponent to create a dynamic 4x4 game board filled with random letters. The board layout in the component template was updated to use a table format, improving its structure and readability. To enhance user experience, the board and cells received styling adjustments, including spacing, colors, and hover effects, creating a more polished, interactive interface. Additionally, a routing issue that caused duplicate rendering of the Play Game link was identified and resolved, ensuring a streamlined display.

Key Changes
-Implemented the **`generateRandomBoard`** method, which generates a 4x4 grid of random letters using the English alphabet (A-Z).
-Each cell in the grid is assigned a random letter, forming a 2D array (board) that represents the game board.
-This board is displayed as a table within the HTML template of the component.
-Board Display and Styling Adjustments
-Created a <table> structure within .board-container to organize the 4x4 letter grid.
-Enhanced styling for .board-container and .cell:
-Set defined cell dimensions and adjusted spacing for improved layout and readability.
-Applied distinct colors for cells and text to enhance visibility and provide a game-like look.
-Added hover effects on each cell to improve interactivity and user engagement.
-Created HomeComponent and assigned it as the default route.
-Updated the routing configuration to remove AppComponent from the routing structure and link / to HomeComponent.
-"Play Game" has been link to HomeComponent to prevent duplication on the main page. Now, HomeComponent is the default route, and AppComponent only serves as the root component with <router-outlet> for routed content.
